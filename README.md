# Ascent

Ascent is a thrilling 2D platformer game. In this game, you control a determined little slime who has set its sights on the peak of a towering mountain which is rumored to contain a magical artifact. Your goal is to help the slime reach the top as quickly as possible.

The game features challenging gameplay where each jump could lead to progress or send you tumbling back down. The controls are simple but mastering the jumps requires practice and precision. The mountain is filled with a variety of platforms, each presenting unique challenges.

As you ascend, you’ll encounter different environments, each with its own set of challenges. The higher you climb, the more difficult the journey becomes, but don’t let that discourage you. With every fall, there’s always a lesson to be learned for the next attempt.
